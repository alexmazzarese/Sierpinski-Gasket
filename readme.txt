For this assignment we were supposed to further modify the "gasket.js" file so that our working Sierpinski Triangle becomes a fully functional website. The goals of this website are to allow the user to change the number of points with a slider and change the colors of the triangle using a number input. The website will also implement draw, clear, and animate functions for the triangle. For this assignment I feel like I completed everything that was required according to the HW2 prompt. Although instead of using the RGB values (0-255 range), I used the values for passing color via thier vector components (0.0-0.1 range). The color input could now look something like [0.3, 0.2, 0.7, 1.0] as opposed to (100, 231, 10), which is what the RGB 0-255 representation would be. This project definitely took a good amount of hours but it was also fun to learn about the different methods of maniplulation regarding the button, onchange() and onclick() features. Overall I think my level of completion for this project was 100%.
